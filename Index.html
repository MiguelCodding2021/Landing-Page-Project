            <h2>7 Habits I Avoid to Become Highly Productive
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you’re reading this, there are a million-and-a-half things you want to do: Build your business,
                exercise more, spend more time with friends and family, read more books, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how do you pack that into a 24-hour day that’s already occupied with sleeping and eating?
            </p>
            <p>
                While most people try to become more productive by adding things, I’ve discovered it's far easier to
                start by subtracting what kills productivity in the first place. Because when you look at highly
                productive people, even though they’re in different industries with different workflows, they always
                avoid key mistakes that sabotage everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re ready to skyrocket your productivity to get more done than ever before, avoid these 7
                specific
                habits. Once you get rid of them, you can see your productivity grow rapidly.

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages today and is easy for beginners
                        to
                        learn because of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming language with
                        extensive
                        support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly
                        data
                        structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for
                        machine
                        learning and deep learning applications.</p>

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p>Java is one of the most common, in-demand computer programming languages used today. Owned by
                        Oracle
                        Corporation, this general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure
                        has
                        become
                        a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Windows,
                        Android,
                        iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result, Java is
                        recognized for its portability across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones.
                        Today
                        there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java.</p>

                    <h3>Kotlin</h3>
                    <p>Kotlin is a general-purpose programming language originally developed and unveiled as Project
                        Kotlin
                        by JetBrains in 2011. The first version was officially released in 2016. It is interoperable
                        with
                        Java and supports functional programming languages.</p>

                    <h3>Rome</h3>
                    <p>Rome, Italian Roma, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province), of Lazio regione
                        (region), and of the country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian
                        peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the
                        capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in
                        antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of
                        the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual
                        achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre,
                        and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past.</p>

                    <h3>Milan</h3>
                    <p>Milan, Italian Milano, city, capital of Milano province (provincia) and of the region (regione)
                        of Lombardy (Lombardia), northern Italy. It is the leading financial centre and the most
                        prosperous manufacturing and commercial city of Italy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The destiny of Milan, like that of many of the world’s great cities, remains something of a
                        historical paradox. There are powerful factors supporting the argument that Milan should have
                        become the capital of a unified Italy, and this is the belief of many Milanese, in spite of the
                        fact that the unity of Italy was actually born in Turin, rather than in Milan, in 1870.

                    <h3>Naples</h3>
                    <p>Naples, Italian Napoli, ancient (Latin) Neapolis (“New Town”), city, capital of Naples provincia,
                        Campania regione, southern Italy. It lies on the west coast of the Italian peninsula, 120 miles
                        (190 km) southeast of Rome. On its celebrated bay—flanked to the west by the smaller Gulf of
                        Pozzuoli and to the southeast by the more extended indentation of the Gulf of Salerno—the city
                        is situated between two areas of volcanic activity: Mount Vesuvius to the east and the Campi
                        Flegrei (Phlegraean Fields) to the northwest. The most recent eruption of Vesuvius occurred in
                        1944. In 1980 an earthquake damaged Naples and its outlying towns, and since then Pozzuoli to
                        the west has been seriously afflicted by bradyseism (a phenomenon involving a fall or rise of
                        land).</p>
